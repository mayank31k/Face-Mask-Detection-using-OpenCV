Face Mask Detection: Using OpenCV and Haar Cascade object Detection

COVID-19 is a disease that spread from human to human, which can be controlled by ensuring the proper use
 of a facial mask. The spread of COVID-19 can be limited if people strictly maintain social distancing and use a
 facial mask. Very sadly, people are not obeying these rules correctly, which is speeding the spread of this virus. 
Detecting the people not obeying the rules and informing the corresponding authorities helps in reducing the 
spread of novel coronavirus. This face mask detection technique is to find out whether someone is wearing a
 mask or not. It is similar to detect any object from a scene. Many systems have been introduced for object
 detection. These techniques and architectures can be incorporated in detecting the face mask. Moreover, a 
smart city means an urban area consists of many IoT sensors and various other cameras to collect data. 
Then this collected data can be used to perform different operations and helps to get statistics across the city. 
This includes monitoring traffic, utilities, water supply network, and many more. 
Recently, the growth of COVID-19 can be reduced by detecting the facial mask in a smart city network.
